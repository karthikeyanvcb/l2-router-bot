"""Top‑level package for the L2 Router Bot.

This package encapsulates all modules required to build and
operate the L2 Router Bot.  It is separate from the hyphenated
project directory so that it can be imported using a valid Python
identifier (``l2_router_bot``).  The directory structure is
arranged such that running ``uvicorn l2_router_bot.main:app``
operates the FastAPI application.
